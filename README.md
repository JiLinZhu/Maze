# Maze
A program that analyzes the different algorithms of maze generation and solving. The process is shown through a GUI.

Created in Feburary 2017 on Java using Netbeans.

Currently working on implementing more complicated algorithms.
Also hope to using Java 3D graphics library to make the mazes 3D.
